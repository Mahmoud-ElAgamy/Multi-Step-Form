**Technologies:**

- **[React](https://react.dev/)**:  
  React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of complex applications efficiently.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**:  
  TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types to the language. It helps developers catch errors early in the development process and improves code maintainability by providing better tooling support.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**:  
  Tailwind CSS is a Utility-First CSS Framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without leaving your HTML. It offers flexibility and efficiency, making it easier to create responsive and highly customizable interfaces.

- **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)**:  
  Framer Motion is a powerful animation library for React that allows developers to create complex animations and gestures with ease. It offers a simple API for animating components and managing transitions, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)**:  
  DaisyUI is a UI library that extends Tailwind CSS with pre-designed components. It helps developers build modern, consistent UIs quickly by providing a set of customizable components like buttons, forms, cards, and more, all built with Tailwindâ€™s utility classes.
